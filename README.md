#RetroidNetplay

RetroidNetplay is by DukedDroid and is an unofficial branch of the open-source project RetroArch that supports Netplay on Android Devices. The NetPlay support is CPU intensive and works on High End android devices such as the Nvidia Shield (tested) and powerful phones such as the Galaxy S4 (untested). 

RetroArch is a simple Multi-emulator frontend based on libretro by Themaister. Libretro is an API designed for simple abstraction of the functions inherent in retro-style, 2D games. While the most common use case for libretro has been console emulation, it is equally suited as a platform for almost any 2D game.

RetroidNetplay is open-source software based on the RetroArch and libretro open-source projects.

RetroidNetplay takes great pride in the work of the RetroArch and libretro projects and we're proud to credit the authors here:  [AUTHORS](https://github.com/RetroidNetplay/AUTHORS)

More information on RetroArch and libretro can be seen in the following RetroArch readme:
# RetroArch

RetroArch (formerly known as SSNES) is a simple frontend for the libretro API. An API that attempts to generalize
a retro gaming system, such as SNES, NES, GameBoy, Arcade machines, etc.
Emulator/game cores are instantiated as loadable plugins.

# libretro

libretro is an API that exposes the core of a retro gaming system.
A frontend for libretro handles video output, audio output and input.
A libretro core written in portable C or C++ can run seamlessly on many platforms.

# Binaries

Latest Windows binaries are currently hosted on my [homepage](http://themaister.net/retroarch.html).

# Philosophy

RetroArch attempts to be very small and lean,
while still having all the useful core features expected from an emulator. 
It is used through command-line. It is also designed to be portable.

# Platforms

RetroArch has been ported to the following platforms outside PC:

   - PlayStation3
   - Xbox 360 (Libxenon/XeXDK)
   - Xbox 1
   - Wii, Gamecube (Libogc)
   - Raspberry Pi
   - Android
   - iOS
   - Blackberry

# Dependencies (PC)

On Windows, RetroArch can run with only Win32 as dependency. On Linux, you need:

   - GL headers
   - X11 headers and libs, or EGL/KMS/GBM

OSX port of RetroArch still requires SDL 1.2 libraries.

RetroArch can utilize these libraries if enabled:

   - nvidia-cg-toolkit
   - libxml2 (GLSL XML shaders)
   - libfreetype2 (TTF font rendering on screen)

RetroArch needs at least one of these audio driver libraries:

   - ALSA
   - OSS
   - RoarAudio
   - RSound
   - OpenAL
   - JACK
   - SDL
   - PulseAudio
   - XAudio2 (Win32, Xbox 360)
   - DirectSound (Win32, Xbox 1)
   - CoreAudio (OSX, iOS)

To run properly, RetroArch requires a libretro implementation present, however, as it's typically loaded
dynamically, it's not required at build time.

# Dependencies (Console ports, mobile)

Console ports have their own dependencies, but generally do not require
anything other than what the respective SDKs provide.

# Configuring

The default configuration is defined in config.def.h. 
These can later be tweaked by using a config file. 
A sample configuration file is installed to /etc/retroarch.cfg. 
This is the system-wide config file. 
Each user should create a config file in $XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/retroarch/retroarch.cfg.
The users only need to configure a certain option if the desired value deviates from the value defined in config.def.h.

To configure joypads, use the <tt>retroarch-joyconfig</tt> tool.
It is also possible to configure joypads using the RetroArch-Phoenix GUI frontend.

# Compiling and installing

<b>PC</b><br/>
Instructions for compiling on PC can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/Themaister/RetroArch/wiki).

<b>PlayStation3</b><br/>

RetroArch PS3 needs to be compiled in the following order:

1) Compile RetroArch Salamander

<tt>make -f Makefile.ps3.salamander</tt>

2) Compile the RGL video driver

<tt>make -f Makefile.ps3.rgl</tt>

3) Compile RetroArch as a library

<tt>make -f Makefile.ps3.retroarch</tt>

4) Finally, compile RetroArch packed together with the GUI:

<tt>make -f Makefile.ps3</tt>

<b>PlayStation3 - Creating a PKG installable file</b><br />

You can add 'pkg' as a parameter in order to make a PKG file - for example:

<tt>make -f Makefile.ps3 pkg</tt>

This creates an NPDRM package. This can be installed on debug PS3s.

To make a non-NPDRM package that can be installed on a jailbroken/CFW PS3 (such as PSGroove or PS3 CFWs and other 3.55 CFW derivatives), do:

<tt>make -f Makefile.ps3 pkg-signed</tt>

If you're using Kmeaw 3.55 firmware, the package needs to be signed:

<tt>make -f Makefile.ps3 pkg-signed-cfw</tt>

NOTE: A pre-existing libretro library needs to be present in the root directory in order to link RetroArch PS3. This file needs to be called <em><b>'libretro_ps3.a'</b></em>.

<b> Xbox 360 (XeXDK)</b><br />

You will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 installed (or higher) in order to compile RetroArch 360.

The solution file can be found at the following location:

<tt>msvc-360/RetroArch-360.sln</tt>

NOTE: A pre-existing libretro library needs to be present in the 'msvc-360/RetroArch-360/Release' directory in order to link RetroArch 360. This file needs to be
called <em><b>'libretro_xdk360.lib'</b></em>.

<b> Xbox 360 (Libxenon)</b><br />

You will need to have the libxenon libraries and a working Devkit Xenon toolchain installed in order to compile RetroArch 360 Libxenon.

<tt>make -f Makefile.xenon</tt>

NOTE: A pre-existing libretro library needs to be present in the root directory in order to link RetroArch 360 Libxenon. This file needs to be called <em><b>'libretro_xenon360.a'</b></em>.

<b> Wii</b><br >

You will need to have the libogc libraries and a working Devkit PPC toolchain installed in order to compile RetroArch Wii.

<tt>make -f Makefile.wii</tt>

NOTE: A pre-existing libretro library needs to be present in the root directory in order to link RetroArch Wii. This file needs to be called <em><b>'libretro_wii.a'</b></em>.
